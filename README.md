# Chaos Game

This is a Rust implementation of the [Chaos Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game) algorithm.

## Sources
[Numberphile has made a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) about Chaos Game, but my main source of information and inspiration was [this website](https://beltoforion.de/en/index.php) which belongs to [Ingo Berg](https://github.com/beltoforion)

## TODO
- [ ] There still is some code cleanup to do
- [ ] There should be at least a bit of theory in this README
- [ ] Better font loading
- [ ] Maybe I should add more fractals other then just [Sierpi≈Ñski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle)
